## Description of SVT algorithm

1. Minimize the nuclear norm of the matrix under certain constraints.
2. Recovering a large matrix from a small subset of its entries.
3. Simple first-order methods are used for problem whose optimal solution has low rank.
4. Iterative. Produce a sequence of matrix at each step. Perform a soft-thresholding operation on the singular value of sparse matrix.
5. Efficient. Minimal storage space.
